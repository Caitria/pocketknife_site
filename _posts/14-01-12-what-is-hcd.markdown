###What is human-centered design?

Trick question. 'User-centered' or 'human-centered' design is exactly what it sounds like. At Pocketknife, we base product and service decisions upon user emotions and motivations. 

Consider the following (hypothetical): 

>*A crack-team of Silicon Valley's finest decide to make yet another food ordering app, but to target people with allergies. They spend months curating a list of recipes from local restaurants and write complex algorithms that match a user's allergy profile with a meal with a green "safe" label. The service fails to attract any users and the founders are baffled.*

While completely hypothetical, this sounds familiar. In this case, a startup would usually pivot, or change target market, or fold. Let's apply a little more understanding of our users to the scenario: 

>*After a few interviews with people with severe food allergies, the founders realize that dining out is an extremely stressful experience for their users. They also realize that both users with allergies, and their parents, have developed the habit of double-checking ingredient lists themselves, no matter what the label says. The founders realize that a green 'safe' label isn't making their users feel safe enough to order. The founders add code to display the ingredients as popdowns.*

Stress, joy, fear, delight, impatience, annoyance. Great products depend upon our ability to understand our users, anticipate their needs, and inform their expectations. The great news is that if you haven't applied design to your problem yet, it isn't too late. If you're pre-project, it isn't too early. 

The insights you get from just a few conversations can completely change the way you pursue a project. I led a design bootcamp this weekend at the Stanford d.school and helped a team navigate "Redesigning the Dining Experience". Here is an interesting insights we stumbled upon in just a 10 minute conversation: 

- *Julia, a college freshman and varsity athlete spoke proudly of becoming a vegetarian, but ate chicken tenders for dinner because her coach told her she needed protein. She found it difficult to balance her view of herself with her dietary needs.*

Do you feel excited about working on that problem? I sure do. That's how I know there's something there - something that needs a little more probing and a little more research. Some problem that, if solved, could help more than just Julia. 


###Resources for the problem-solvers among you
- [**IDEO'S HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN TOOLKIT**](http://www.ideo.com/work/human-centered-design-toolkit/)  IDEO has a fantastic field guide for organizations trying to understand the real needs of their communities.  
- [**THE BOOTCAMP BOOTLEG**](http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/BootcampBootleg2010v2SLIM.pdf)  Stanford's d.school provides a ~50 page compilation of user research and prototyping methods. This is a great collection of methodologies, but less useful as a guide through the design process.
