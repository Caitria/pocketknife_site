### How conversations lead to product

People are complex, twisty and counterintuitive. That's what makes dates interesting and design fun. In this post I'll share three tools you can use to better understand your users. 

<!--more-->

First a note on when to dive into 'empathic research.' Open-ended and [generative research](http://johnnyholland.org/2012/03/finding-empathy-through-generative-research/) is fantastic when you've got a big question or you are looking for a game changing idea. If you're just trying to decide between red and blue for a button on your website, I'll write a post for you later.

## Method 1. Immerse
<img src="{% asset_path chaplin.jpg %}" style="float:right; padding-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;" width="400px">
Go out and experience the product or service you're trying to transform. If you're trying to make an app to help seniors order perscriptions, go try to fill a subscription physically. Sometimes you'll find that the experience instructive. Sometimes you'll find that the experience isn't broken enough to gain users with a slightly better solution. 

[Here's a great example](http://learningactivist.com/2013/06/28/insight-through-design-thinking-immersion/) of learning about users through immersion by Mark Burgess. He broke dress code as a school employee in order to experience, to some degree, the reactions and emotions students experienced when doing the same thing. 

##Method 2. Observe
<img src="{% asset_path observe.jpg %}" style="float:right; padding-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;" width="400px">Observation is easy - actively watch your user and take notes. As an observer you can record a lot of objective information, and begin to make infer subjective motivations or emotions. You can observe your users completing the task you're trying to facilitate, or doing something unrelated that they love. You're just trying to understand a little bit more about how people tick, and explore potential areas for innovation.

I'll use the picture above to highlight the process. Ask yourself:

- **WHAT** are they doing? Start with concrete observations. In this picture, an older man is putting on makeup. There are several other make-up stations in the room. 
- **HOW** are they doing it? Does it require effort? Does it look like fun? In our example, the man has all of his application utensils lain out neatly on a white cloth. There seems to be some sort of routine or ritual - he might do this often. He looks bored or sad. Man, keeping up with those eyebrows must suck. 
- **WHY** are they doing this? As designers, we must make small leaps from the observed to the inferred in order to frame solutions. Ask, "what might this mean?", and keep in mind that these are small assumptions that you can test or clarify later on with your users. I wonder if this guy is a professional. I wonder if he values this ritual, or order.  

*Please note!* The man in the photograph is not in the least put off by the slighty creepy observer behind him. Don't worry about being caught staring or asking if you can observe. People are generally extremely  nice. 

##Method 3. For Pete's sake, just talk to somebody

<img src="{% asset_path interview.jpg %}" style="float:right; padding-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;" width="400px">

The single best way to understand your users is to speak with them. Start off slow and get comfortable engaging in quick 'intercept' conversations. I use the following formula: 
"Hi! I'm Caitria O'Neill, and I'm doing a bit of research for Company-X about Research-Topic-Y. Could I speak with you for a few minutes today? "
Not rocket science, but about 90% of the people I ask say yes. The 10% that say no are usually nice about it. 

Your early interviews are a success if you can build a bit of rapport, get to a story and explore an emotion. Stories are important in design because they lead us to topics which we might not have suggested and emotions we might not have been able to ask about directly. Consider the following: 

>*"So, do you usually eat eggs for breakfast?"*

>*"er, no?"*

and compare it to: 

>*"Could you tell me what you ate for breakfast this morning?"*

>*"God, this has been a busy week. I just grabbed a cold slice of pizza on the way out the door. Then my boss has been on my ass about getting to work on time but smelling like garlic."*

Wow! In roughly 20 seconds my interviewee has opened up and given me an opening to ask more direct questions about his rushed breakfast experiences. I'm already excited about the possibility of helping this guy get to work on time, well fed and smelling like a promotion. 


I have a lot of great tips and methods to pull out in interviews, but that deserves its own post. I'll add part two later - for now, adieu.
