Pocketknife designer/mountaineer Caitria will be hosting [next week's #dchat](http://dschool.stanford.edu/fellowships/2014/01/10/design-disasters-caitria-on-dchat/) at the Stanford Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (the d.school) on Tuesday 1/14 from 6-7pm. Topic: Design & Disasters.

"Disasters suck, disaster recovery doesn't have to. I got some first-hand experience after EF3 tornado that struck my hometown. I went on to found Recovers.org, adisaster tech company, before arriving at Stanford and Pocketknife. I'll be joining #dchat this week to talk about next weekâ€™s question: how might we incorporate design into disaster recovery? 

Who would you help? Where would you start? What are some analogous scenarios that people have designed for? If you have questions for me ahead of time, be sure to send them over Twitter using the hashtag #dchat or post them in the comments below. I'll will be online from 6pm-7pm PT on 11/14 to take your questions! In the meantime, you can follow me at [@CaitriaONeill.](https://twitter.com/CaitriaONeill)"
