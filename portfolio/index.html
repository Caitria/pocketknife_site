        Sure, we can design and build beautiful software, but what the thing that really starts our engines is figuring out the <a href="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/500x/44445734.jpg">WHY </a>to both the problem and the proposed solution. We combine <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/interviewing-humans">design research</a> and lightweight prototyping to make sure by the time the first lines of code are finished we're building you a solution that will sell.
