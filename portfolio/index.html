    <p>
        Sure, we can design and build beautiful software, but what the thing that really starts our engines is figuring out the <a href="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/500x/44445734.jpg">WHY </a>to both the problem and the proposed solution. We combine <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/interviewing-humans">design research</a> and lightweight prototyping to make sure by the time the first lines of code are finished we're building you a solution that will sell.

        Prior to joining Pocketknife, Caitria was the co-founder and CEO of Recovers.org, an award winning disaster relief platform. Inspired by a tornado in her hometown, Monson, MA, she developed tools to help neighbors handle the resources that pour into their communities after disasters. There's no better way to create software than on the ground with your users - Caitria <a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2012/ideas-team-profile-recovers.html">spent weeks</a> in disaster areas working with survivors to co-design solutions to the problems they faced.
