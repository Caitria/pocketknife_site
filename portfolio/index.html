    <h1>We're Pretty Cool Individuals</h1>
    <h2 class="sub">But Why Should You Hire Us?</h2>
    <p>
      Sure, we can design and build beautiful software, but what 
      really starts our engines is figuring out the
      <a href="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/500x/44445734.jpg">WHY</a>
      to both the problem and proposed solution. We combine
      <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/interviewing-humans">design research</a>
      and lightweight prototyping to make sure by the time the first
      lines of code are written, we're building a solution that delights
      you and your users.

      Prior to joining Pocketknife, Caitria was the co-founder and
      CEO of Recovers.org, an award winning disaster relief
      platform. Inspired by a tornado in her hometown, Monson, MA,
      she developed tools to help neighbors handle the resources
      that pour into their communities after disasters. There's no
      better way to create software than on the ground with your
      users - Caitria
      <a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2012/ideas-team-profile-recovers.html">spent weeks</a>
      in disaster areas working with survivors to co-design solutions
      to the problems they faced.
    </p>

    <p>   
      Keeping respect for users at the core of all research and
      development led to software that has helped hundreds of
      thousands of people get involved in local recovery. Caitria received a
      <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/champions/civic-hacking-and-open-government/caitria-o%E2%80%99neill">Champion of Change </a>
      award from the White House for her contributions to the field of disaster recovery.

      Thomas served as the lead backend engineer at Runway 20, helping
      move the company from idea through implementation across several
      product iterations. These products included an intelligent
      personal assistant, รก la Google now, and a full fledged email
      client.
    </p>

    <p>
      Treading these various domains allowed Thomas to get elbow deep
      technologies such as distributed databases (<3
      <a href="http://basho.com/riak">riak</a>+<a href="www.postgresql.org">postgres</a>),
      the <a href={% asset_path trifecta.png %}>trifecta of HTML5</a>,
      iOS integration, and
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">NLP</a>.
      Farther away from the brass tacks, nuts, and bolts, Runway 20's
      quick iterations helped him hammer together a methodology for making
      a product that people want.</p>
