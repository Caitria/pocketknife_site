		<h1>Design Process</h1>
		<p>
			Let's work together! Here's a look at our design and engineering
			processes. If you can use help in any of the following areas,
			let's get together and discuss your goals and timeline.
		</p>
		<br>
		<img src={% asset_path sweatshirt.svg %} height="148px" style="float: left;"><h2> 1. Needfinding & User Research</h2>
		<p>
			We use human-centered design and methods pioneered at Stanford's
			d.school to get to know your users and the problems they face. A
			successful research sprint culminates in a clear strategy and
			scope for future work.
		</p>
		<br>
		<img src={% asset_path skis.svg %} style="float: right;"/><h2 style="text-align: right;">2. Concept Design & Prototyping</h2>
		<p>
			Based upon our understanding of your business goals and user
			needs, we quickly design and prototype solutions to work toward
			a final set of designs for the function, architecture, and
			visual interface of your product.
		</p>
		<br>
		<img src={% asset_path skilift.svg %} height="148px" style="float: left;"><h2> 3. Engineering, Documentation & Support</h2>
		<p>
			We build your big idea, turning a successful prototype into a
			functional, scalable and marketable product. Working with your
			team, we choose technologies that make sense for the task and
			work for your team. We document beautifully and hand off
			smoothly.
